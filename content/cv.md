# Summary
Senior software engineer, with a tendency to find and fix problems. 10+ years of experience in GIS and 3D technologies, especially web and client-server apps. Quick learner, broad rather than deep, and with a good sense for product and team leadership. In my last job, I led a development team of 25 people, as well as the roadmap and releases of two products, now looking for a more technical role after a career break to recharge and refocus.
